# About

## Hi, I'm Antoine D. Bedward

Instructional designer and educational enthusiast.

I decided to dedicate my life to education a few years ago after experiencing the benefit of online education working for the public sector in Canada. 

From there, I went on to earn a Masters in Education at Athabasca University. My research focused on optimizing user experience in online higher education. I graduated after defending my [thesis][0]: a comparative study about student experiences in online and face-to-face universities. I spent the next year working in the public sector again applying what I learned throughout my research in high security departments. My hard work and attention to detail paid off when I was accepted at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto. 

In Toronto, I split my time researching the potential of large scale international programs in engineering education, and working for the public sector implementing learning environments for 250,000+ users. 

During this time, I realized that we are at the tipping point of the educational revolution. Higher education and corporate learning are evolving, and the landscape is about to change forever.

Drop me a line if you are curious.
